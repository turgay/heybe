Heybe

Heybe is a simple web app to collect links to read/watch/check later.Initial idea was to have an easy 'read it later' app.


It is in progres and incomplete.

It is being implemented in Go.  By this web app, I'd like to see how easy to build a web app in Go.
 - Uses Go's standard packages as much as possible.
 - Depends on github.com/gorilla/mux
 - Uses Bootstrap in UI


TODO Planned
-------------
- Add database support
- Encode pwd
- Forgotten pwd support
- Remember user
- Synch with bookmarks


RoadMap
--------
- Chrome and Firefox extension
